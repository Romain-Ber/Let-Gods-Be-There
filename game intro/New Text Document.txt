Murder. War. Death.
Famine. Disasters. Plagues.
Greed. Rape. Misery. 
What a beautiful world.
I shall thank the gods for shaping the world to their images.
And I admire your faith, your obedience and your patience.
Wait, am I really though?
Nah, see, you're an absolute moron.
The worst of the sheeps.
This world couldn't be more of a shithole,
Yet here you are, bending over backwards,
Getting that little lime slice of yours you call an asshole all mushy,
Begging for any cock around to push deeper.
To me, that's what you're achieving by praying the gods.
Fuck them.
They're just legends.
Relics of the past.
I'll be dead cold meat before you see me kneeling toward any of them.
This is a joke and this entire world's logic angers me.
Fuck the lot of you.
I will follow my own ways.
My identity. My path. My Will.
